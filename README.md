# videostitcher_public

Important: 
Videostitcher is NOT finished now. Use it at your own Risk!!! 

Operational: 
Videostitcher is supposed to be used for stitching large amounts of corrupted videofiles in timely correct order after a datacrash and data recovery of disks/storage devices, recovered by (linux) testdisk and photorec on a fast desktop PC or server


Usage:
Currently it is still not very usable by a simple commandline, because of the almost completely different usage of underlying ffmpeg, mplayer and avifix binaries. 
YOU HAVE TO KNOW PYTHON2/3 VERY WELL and to use sometimes some online translator to understand some german comments

Depends:
Python2/3, pymediainfo, pandas, ffmpeg, mplayer and avifix!!!

Remarks:
Due to afore mentioned problems with the not uniform and not very easy (really said: completely weird and messy) commandlines and videoformats/standards of ffmpeg, mplayer, avifix etc., it is still 
a Trial and Error to get correct result. Everyone is encouraged to make it better in usage etc.
